## Login Credentials

## Admin View: 

Upon successful login using admin credentials, users will be automatically redirected to the product listing page. Here, they are granted the ability to perform actions such as adding, updating, and deleting products from the system. The challenge we encountered pertains to the implementation of pagination on the listing page due to limited data provided by the API. To enhance the user experience, a loader has been seamlessly integrated during data retrieval to improve overall performance.

## User View:

Upon successfully logging in with user credentials, users will be directed to the storefront interface. Here, they gain access to a comprehensive list of product categories. Within each category, users can explore product listings tailored to their category selection. To optimize the user experience, a loader has been thoughtfully integrated into every data retrieval process, ensuring seamless and responsive data loading.

## More Details 
While the website has made significant strides, it remains a work in progress, with ample room for enhancements and the incorporation of additional functionalities, such as state management. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, certain improvements and design refinements couldn't be fully implemented.
